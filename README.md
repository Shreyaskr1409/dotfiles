# Dotfiles

These dotfiles include:
- hyprland config
- sway config
- nvim config
- rofi config
- waybar config

This repo is supposed to stay as a backup for my dotfiles. For these backups, I am using a tool called [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

If you want to install these files, prefer checking out chezmoi first and then installing. This is because the naming of these config files work a bit differently with chezmoi.
